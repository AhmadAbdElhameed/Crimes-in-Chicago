# Crimes-in-Chicago
I will explore crimes in Chicago from a perspective of a Chicago resident who wants to know more about the subject so he can better navigate his way through the city. The Chicago Crime dataset contains a summary of the reported crimes occurred in the City of Chicago from 2001 to 2020. Dataset has been obtained from the Chicago Police Department's CLEAR (Citizen Law Enforcement Analysis and Reporting) system.


In this notebook, I am going to explore more about crime in Chicago and try to answer few questions:
- How has crime in Chicago changed across years?
- the bloodiest year in two decades?
- Are some types of crimes more likely to happen in specific locations or specific time of the day or specific day of the week than other types of crimes?
